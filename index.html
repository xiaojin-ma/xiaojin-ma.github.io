Advised by <a href="https://psych.wustl.edu/people/richard-abrams" target="_blank">Dr. Richard A. Abrams</a>, I study visual attention, cognitive control, and the interaction between perception and action. My research questions what factors affect attentional deployment across visual scenes, and how the distractive effect of salient-but-irrelevant sensory inputs can be inhibited. I work primarily in R and Python, and approach research questions with behavioral methods, eye tracking, and computational modeling. </p>
