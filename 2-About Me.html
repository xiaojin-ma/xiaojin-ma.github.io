    <p> I was originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen" target="_blank">Shenzhen, China</a>, and earned my B.S. in Psychology from South China Normal University in 2018.</p> 
    <p> In my free time, I like exploring fine art and fashion design. Below are some of my works:</p>
